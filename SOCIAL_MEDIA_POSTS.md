### Title:
Need advice: Should I aggressively prepay my ₹2.35Cr home loan or invest the surplus? [India]

### Post Body:

Hi everyone,

I'm 32M, recently took a home loan and trying to figure out the optimal strategy for my surplus income. Would really appreciate your thoughts on this.

**My Financial Situation:**

**Income:**
- Monthly Salary: ₹3.5L
- Other Income (rental + side projects): ₹3L
- Total: ₹6.5L/month (₹78L/year)

**Expenses:**
- Total Monthly: ₹3L (including ₹1.75L EMI)
- Non-loan expenses: ₹50K
- Savings Rate: ~54%

**Assets:**
- Emergency Fund: ₹30L (10 months of expenses, 60 months of non-loan expenses)
- Liquid Savings: ₹2L
- Investment Portfolio: ₹1.5Cr
- Current SIP: ₹1.3L/month

**Liabilities:**
- Home Loan: ₹2.35Cr @ 7.5% for 25 years
- EMI: ₹1.75L/month
- Just started in Jan 2025

**Monthly Surplus: ₹3L** (after all expenses and current SIP)

---

**The Dilemma:**

I have ₹3L surplus every month and I'm torn between:

1. **Aggressive Prepayment (80-20):** Put ₹2.4L towards loan, ₹60K in investments
   - Become debt-free in ~10 years
   - Save ~₹1.8Cr in interest
   - But miss out on compounding

2. **Balanced (50-50):** ₹1.5L prepayment, ₹1.5L investment
   - Debt-free in ~15 years
   - Save ~₹1.2Cr in interest
   - Build decent corpus

3. **Wealth Focus (20-80):** ₹60K prepayment, ₹2.4L investment
   - Debt-free in ~20 years
   - Save ~₹50L in interest
   - But carry loan for longer

---

**What I'm Currently Thinking:**

I built a simple calculator to run the numbers, and here's what it suggests:

**Recommended: 20-80 Split (Wealth Focus)**

*Reasoning:*
- Loan just started (25 years remaining)
- Expected equity returns (12%) > Loan rate (7.5%)
- Post-tax returns still beat loan rate by 2-3%
- Strong emergency fund already in place
- Long time horizon for compounding

*Projected Outcome (25 years):*
- Investment corpus: ₹10.5Cr (₹3.7L/month SIP @ 12%)
- Interest saved: ₹50L from prepayment
- Net worth: ~₹10Cr
- Loan paid off in 20 years instead of 25

*vs Aggressive Prepayment (80-20):*
- Loan paid in 10 years
- Interest saved: ₹1.8Cr
- Investment corpus: ₹5.4Cr
- Net worth: ~₹5.4Cr
- **₹4.6Cr less than wealth focus!**

---

**My Concerns:**

1. **Psychological:** Carrying a ₹2Cr+ loan for 20 years feels heavy, even though math says invest
2. **Market Risk:** What if equity returns are only 8-9% instead of 12%?
3. **Interest Rate Risk:** What if rates go up and I can't refinance?
4. **Opportunity Cost:** Am I being too optimistic about returns?
5. **Tax Benefits:** Currently maxing out 80C (₹1.5L) and getting 24(b) deduction (₹2L interest). Should I factor this more?

---

**Questions for the Community:**

1. Does the 20-80 split make sense given my profile, or am I being too aggressive with investments?
2. Should I consider a dynamic strategy (adjust based on market conditions)?
3. Anyone here carried a large home loan while building wealth? How did it work out?
4. Am I underestimating the psychological burden of debt?
5. What would you do in my situation?

I know the math favors investing when returns > loan rate, but I'd love to hear from people who've actually been through this journey.

Thanks in advance for your insights!

*P.S. - I'm in India, so tax treatment is different (80C for principal, 24(b) for interest, LTCG on equity @ 10% above ₹1L). Also, our loan prepayment is more flexible than US (no penalties in most cases).*

**The ₹2.35 Crore Question: Prepay or Invest?** 🏠💰

Just took a home loan and facing the classic dilemma every homeowner deals with:

*"I have ₹3L surplus every month. Should I aggressively prepay my loan or invest it?"*

Here's my situation:
• 25-year loan @ 7.5%
• ₹1.75L EMI
• Strong emergency fund (10 months)
• Already investing ₹1.3L/month
• ₹3L additional surplus

**The Math:**

📊 Option 1: Aggressive Prepayment (80%)
→ Debt-free in 10 years
→ Save ₹1.8Cr in interest
→ Net worth: ₹5.4Cr

📈 Option 2: Wealth Focus (20% prepay, 80% invest)
→ Debt-free in 20 years
→ Save ₹50L in interest
→ Net worth: ₹10Cr

**The difference? ₹4.6 Crores!**

But here's the catch - carrying a ₹2Cr+ loan for 20 years isn't easy psychologically, even when the math says invest.

**My current thinking:**
Focus on wealth building (20-80 split) because:
✅ Long time horizon (25 years)
✅ Expected returns (12%) > Loan rate (7.5%)
✅ Strong financial foundation
✅ Tax benefits on both sides

**But I'm conflicted:**
❓ What if market returns disappoint?
❓ Am I underestimating the peace of mind from being debt-free?
❓ Should I use a dynamic strategy instead?

**Question for the community:**
What would you do? Have you faced this dilemma? How did it turn out?

Would love to hear your experiences and perspectives! 💭

## Twitter/X Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook):
Just took a ₹2.35Cr home loan.

Have ₹3L surplus every month.

The math says invest. My gut says prepay.

Here's the dilemma every homeowner faces 🧵

### Tweet 2 (Setup):
My situation:
• 25-year loan @ 7.5%
• ₹1.75L EMI
• ₹6.5L monthly income
• 54% savings rate
• ₹1.5Cr existing portfolio
• ₹30L emergency fund

Question: What to do with ₹3L surplus?

### Tweet 3 (Options):
Option A: Aggressive Prepayment (80%)
• Debt-free in 10 years
• Save ₹1.8Cr interest
• Net worth: ₹5.4Cr

Option B: Wealth Focus (80% invest)
• Debt-free in 20 years
• Save ₹50L interest
• Net worth: ₹10Cr

Difference: ₹4.6 CRORES! 🤯

### Tweet 4 (Analysis):
The math is clear:

Equity returns (12%) > Loan rate (7.5%)

Even post-tax, investing wins by 2-3%

Over 25 years, this compounds to ₹4.6Cr difference

But...

### Tweet 5 (Concerns):
The psychological burden is REAL:

• Carrying ₹2Cr+ debt for 20 years
• What if returns are only 8-9%?
• What if rates increase?
• Peace of mind vs wealth maximization

Math ≠ Emotions

### Tweet 6 (Question):
I'm leaning towards 20-80 split (wealth focus) because:

✅ Long horizon
✅ Strong foundation
✅ Returns > rate
✅ Tax benefits

But I'd love to hear from people who've actually done this.

What would YOU do?

Hey everyone! 👋

Need some financial advice from the group.

Just took a ₹2.35Cr home loan and trying to figure out the best strategy for my ₹3L monthly surplus.

**Quick context:**
- 25-year loan @ 7.5%
- ₹1.75L EMI
- Good emergency fund (₹30L)
- Already investing ₹1.3L/month

**The question:**
Should I aggressively prepay (80% of surplus) or focus on investing (80% of surplus)?

**The math:**
- Aggressive prepayment: Debt-free in 10 years, ₹5.4Cr net worth
- Wealth focus: Debt-free in 20 years, ₹10Cr net worth
- Difference: ₹4.6 Crores! 😱

**My dilemma:**
Math says invest (returns > loan rate), but carrying ₹2Cr+ debt for 20 years feels heavy psychologically.

What would you do? Anyone been through this?

Would love to hear your experiences! 🙏
